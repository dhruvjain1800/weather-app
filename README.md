## 🧠 Architectural Decisions

- **Redux Toolkit** is used for predictable, centralized state management.
- **Axios** is used with a general API client (`apiClient.ts`) to centralize config and simplify API calls.
- **Feature separation**: Components, screens, logic, and styling are separated by responsibility.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Every component does one thing only.

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests written using **Jest** and **@testing-library/react-native**.
- Run tests with:

```bash
yarn test
# or
npm test
```
